# Attention based Sequence to Sequence for RUL
 Proposed ATS2S model on C-MAPSS dataset.

This repo contains code of the paper, 	[ Attention based Sequence to Sequence for RUL]. It includes code for estimating remaining useful life machine using sequence to sequence model with axuulary task to improve the feature representation.

### Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* python 2.\* or python 3.\*
* Pytorch v1.2+

### Data
The model performance is tested on NASA turbofan engines dataset[https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan]. You can see more details about data here 

### Usage
To run the code, we have to main file, single working condition model `model_single_wk_data.py` and multiple working model  `model_multi_wk_data.py.
